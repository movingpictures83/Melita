Melita Pipeline: DPStats
Usage: java DPStats <inputfile> <outputdirectory>

Description: A pipeline that accepts a sequence database (RDP),
a set of forward and reverse degenerate primers, and their identifiers
and outputs statistics regarding taxon-specific PCR amplification

Inputfile contains keyword-value pairs on separate lines.  Required keywords:
sequencefile: Sequence database (RDP)
primerfile: List of forward and reverse primers, and their idnetifiers

For each forward/reverse primer pair, outputs the following files prefixed by their identifier
 in the <outputdirectory>:
*amplSeqID.txt: Sequences/taxa amplified by PCR
*NE.txt: NE=Nonexistent sequences/taxa, in other words could not be amplified
*ND.txt: ND=Nondistinct sequences/taxa that were amplified
*AmpliconMap*: Matrix with rows corresponding to taxa and columns to the primer.  Entry (i, j)
is the amount of sequences corresponding to taxa i amplified by primer k
*New*: Number of new taxa amplified

Additionally, the following files are produced in the root directory, suffixed by database
and an identifier for the primer set.

amplStats*: More descriptive statistics (degree, longest common subsequence, temperature and GC% ranges)
that include those specific to the forward and reverse primers
amplStatsNoFR*: More summative statistics for the primer pair in general.
combine2Ampl*: Results from using all pairs of primers, including amount of overlap, phyla, genera,
and species amplified.
