Melita Pipeline: DBStat
Usage: ./runMelita.sh DBStat <inputfile>

Description: A pipeline that outputs statistics on database files.
At the moment it takes one RDP file, one Silva file, and one HMDP file.
It can easily be fixed to accept one of the three, that is future work.

Statistics output:
Sequence counts
Number of unique sequences
Number of unique genera
Number of unique speices
Sequences that map to one distinguishing taxa

In addition it will output the genera and species that map
to multiple sequence identifiers to files, with the following format:
<Database>_multSeqIDPer<Genus/Specie><Number of sequence identifiers>.txt

<inputfile> is a tab-delimited textfile of keyword-value pairs.  Keywords (all required)
include:

KEYWORD		DESCRIPTION
rdpfile		RDP database file
silvafile	Silva database file
hmdpfile	HMDP database file
