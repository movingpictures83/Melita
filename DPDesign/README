Melita Pipeline: DPDesign
Usage: java DPDesign <inputfile>

Description: A pipeline that takes as input a database of sequences from RDP. 

It produces as output a set of possible forward and reverse primers for these
sequences, and their counts to the console.

Primers are output as two .txt files:
*list.txt: Each possible primer on its own separate line.
*dsgnFlow.txt: The flow of computation for each primer, including its degeneracy score.

Also included in these filenames are minimum sequence count,
maximum degeneracy score, and minimum C/G nucletoide count (these are the strong bases
that improve PCR efficiency).  All of these can be changed (see Core/CONSTANT.java).
Future goal can be to make these input parameters.
