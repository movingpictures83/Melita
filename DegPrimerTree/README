Melita Pipeline: DegPrimerTree
Usage: java DegPrimerTree <inputfile>

Description: A pipeline that takes as input a database of sequences
and their corresponding taxa. 

It will then output a set of taxon-specific degenerate primers 
using the algorithm of (Jaric et al., 2013).  

Part of this algorithm involves a phylogenetic clustering of the sequences,
for which information is displayed first.  What will follow is an iteration
through the resulting tree, producing forward and reverse degenerate primers
that meet a specified set of criteria for each node in the three.
